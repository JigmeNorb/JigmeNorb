        <h1>DEFINITION OF DRAWING.</h1>
        <P>Drawing is the act of creating visual art using various tools like pencils, pens, markers, charcoal, or digital devices. It involves making lines, shapes, and marks on a surface, often on paper or canvas, to represent objects, scenes, concepts, or abstract forms. Drawing can be both a technical skill and a form of self-expression, ranging from detailed and realistic representations to loose and abstract designs.
            It's a versatile art form that can be used for everything from planning larger works of art to capturing spontaneous ideas and emotions. Whether you're sketching a quick doodle or working on a detailed masterpiece, drawing allows you to communicate visually and explore your creativity.</P>
